# Generate Function Specification

A modification has been applied to a codebase to achieve the developer intent below, adding a function that has no behavioral specification yet. Generate its specification from scratch.

- Function fully-qualified name: `src::languages::erlang-py::ElpClient::_next_message` (language: `python`).
- Comment prefix for this language: `#`.
- Known callees of this function: (none).

## Developer intent

# Incremental self-validation intent

Validate all behavioral and correctness impacts introduced between the recorded
FM-Agent baseline and the current checked-out main-derived revision. Regenerate
specifications for changed or relevant functions and verify affected callers.
Pay particular attention to file readiness, incremental reasoning, CLI backend,
codegraph integration, tracing, environment checks, and pipeline setup changes.
Do not modify project source files; write validation artifacts only under the
FM-Agent workspace.

## Function source

```python
def _next_message(self, deadline: float):
        remaining = deadline - time.monotonic()
        if remaining <= 0:
            raise TimeoutError("timed out waiting for ELP")
        try:
            message = self._messages.get(timeout=remaining)
        except queue.Empty as exc:
            raise TimeoutError("timed out waiting for ELP") from exc
        if isinstance(message, BaseException):
            raise RuntimeError(str(message)) from message
        return message
```

## Specs of this function's callers

### src::languages::erlang-py::ElpClient::initialize

# [SPEC]
# Unit: src/languages/erlang.py
#
# ElpClient.initialize(self, bootstrap_path: str, bootstrap_source: str | None = None)
#
# Pre-condition:
#   - self is an ElpClient whose __enter__ has been called (ELP subprocess is
#     running, stdin/stdout pipes are open, and the JSON-RPC message reader
#     thread is active)
#   - bootstrap_path is a non-empty string identifying a filesystem path; if
#     bootstrap_source is None, bootstrap_path must resolve to an existing,
#     readable text file
#   - bootstrap_source, when provided, is a string containing the document
#     content to use instead of reading from bootstrap_path
#
# Post-condition:
#   - Completes the LSP initialization handshake: sends the "initialize"
#     request with client capabilities, then sends the "initialized"
#     notification
#   - Opens the document at bootstrap_path on the server with the text content
#     matching bootstrap_source (or the file contents of bootstrap_path when
#     bootstrap_source is None)
#   - Blocks until the server's reported status indicates it has reached a
#     running state, or raises TimeoutError when that does not occur within
#     self.timeout seconds measured from the call entry
#   - Returns the "serverInfo" sub-dict from the server's "initialize"
#     response, or None when the response is missing, is not a dict, or does
#     not contain a "serverInfo" key
#   - Raises RuntimeError when the ELP subprocess is not running (stdin
#     unavailable) or the JSON-RPC channel encounters an unrecoverable error
#   - Raises TimeoutError when the server fails to reach the running state
#     within the deadline or the subprocess stops producing messages
# [SPEC]

## What callers expect from this function (from their [INFO] blocks)

Your generated [SPEC] must be consistent with these expectations.

### According to src::languages::erlang-py::ElpClient::initialize

# _next_message(self, deadline: float)
#   Pre-condition: deadline is a future point in time expressed as a
#     monotonic clock value; the message reader thread is active and
#     writing to the internal message queue
#   Post-condition: Returns the next complete parsed JSON-RPC message
#     received from the server as a dict before deadline expires; raises
#     TimeoutError when the deadline is reached before a message arrives;
#     raises RuntimeError when the reader thread terminated with an
#     exception

## Steps

1. Read `fm_agent/spec_prompts/system_prompt.md` for the exact [SPEC]/[INFO] format rules used by this project.
2. Produce the COMPLETE [SPEC] block describing this function's behavior — the `[SPEC]` ... `[SPEC]` block only, markers included, every line prefixed with `#`, and NO source code.
3. This function has no callees, so produce no [INFO] block.
4. Write your answer to `fm_agent/spec_generate_132.json` as a JSON object with keys:
   - "spec_updated": boolean — true when you produced a [SPEC] block.
   - "new_spec": string — the full [SPEC] block.
   - "info_updated": boolean — true when you produced an [INFO] block.
   - "new_info": string — the full [INFO] block, or "" if none.
   - "updated_callees": array of callee name strings recorded in [INFO], or [].
   Write ONLY that JSON file; do not modify any other project files.
