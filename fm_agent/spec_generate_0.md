# Generate Function Specification

A modification has been applied to a codebase to achieve the developer intent below, adding a function that has no behavioral specification yet. Generate its specification from scratch.

- Function fully-qualified name: `config-py::Settings::settings_customise_sources` (language: `python`).
- Comment prefix for this language: `#`.
- Known callees of this function: __init__.

## Developer intent

# Incremental self-validation intent

Validate all behavioral and correctness impacts introduced between the recorded
FM-Agent baseline and the current checked-out main-derived revision. Regenerate
specifications for changed or relevant functions and verify affected callers.
Pay particular attention to file readiness, incremental reasoning, CLI backend,
codegraph integration, tracing, environment checks, and pipeline setup changes.
Do not modify project source files; write validation artifacts only under the
FM-Agent workspace.

## Function source

```python
def settings_customise_sources(
        cls,
        settings_cls,
        init_settings,
        env_settings,
        dotenv_settings,
        file_secret_settings,
    ):
        # init (programmatic) wins; everything else is folded into _LayeredSource,
        # which already applies env > toml > field defaults.
        return (init_settings, _LayeredSource(settings_cls, _CONFIG_PATH))
```

## Steps

1. Read `fm_agent/spec_prompts/system_prompt.md` for the exact [SPEC]/[INFO] format rules used by this project.
2. Produce the COMPLETE [SPEC] block describing this function's behavior — the `[SPEC]` ... `[SPEC]` block only, markers included, every line prefixed with `#`, and NO source code.
3. Because this function has callees, also produce an [INFO] block recording the expected behavioral spec of each callee it depends on (the `[INFO]` ... `[INFO]` block only, markers included, every line prefixed with `#`), and list the names of the callees you recorded.
4. Write your answer to `fm_agent/spec_generate_0.json` as a JSON object with keys:
   - "spec_updated": boolean — true when you produced a [SPEC] block.
   - "new_spec": string — the full [SPEC] block.
   - "info_updated": boolean — true when you produced an [INFO] block.
   - "new_info": string — the full [INFO] block, or "" if none.
   - "updated_callees": array of callee name strings recorded in [INFO], or [].
   Write ONLY that JSON file; do not modify any other project files.
